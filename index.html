        <h1>Linkin Park - Looking For An Answer</h1>
		<p>There's an emptiness tonight
			A hole that wasn't there before
			And I keep reaching for the light
			And I can't find it anymore

			There's an emptiness tonight
			A heavy hand that pulls me down
			They say it's gonna be alright
			They can't begin to tell me how

			And I ask myself out loud

			Have I been lost all along
			Was there something I could say or something I should not have done
			Was I lost all along
			Was I looking for an answer
			When there never really was one
			Was I looking for an answer
			When there never really was one

			Is there sunshine where you are
			The way that was when you were here
			Cause I'm just sitting in the dark 
			In disbelief that this is real
			In disbelief that this is real</p>
